# Challenge_Porto
  My opening assignments on the two first semesters during college:
  I was responsible for the part of Computational Thinking Using Python (CTUP), but since I was also the group leader I had to help the other members and allign all the parts of our assignment. This project consists in the system devolpment for bicycle inspection. The company Porto was the requester of the project, they needed a system specified in bicycle inspections only. The system nedded to work online, without employees and be self-sufficient.
  This project is divided in six parts, being them: Computational Thiking with Python, Software Design & Total Experience, Domain Driven Design, AI and Chatbot, Responsive Web Development and Building Relational Database. Those are the names of the subjects of this first two semesters.
