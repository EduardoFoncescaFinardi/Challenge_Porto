# Challenge_Porto

## Overview
This project is an assignment completed during the first two semesters of college as part of the Computational Thinking Using Python (CTUP) course. The objective of the project was to develop a system for bicycle inspection, catering specifically to the requirements of the company Porto, who requested the system. The system needed to function online, operate autonomously without any employees, and be self-sufficient.

## Project Responsibilities
As the group leader for this project, I had the additional responsibility of coordinating and assisting other team members to ensure the successful completion of all project components. The project is divided into six parts, each focusing on different aspects of development and design:

1.Computational Thinking with Python: This section involves applying computational thinking principles using Python programming language.

2.Software Design & Total Experience: In this phase, the emphasis is on software design principles and creating a user-friendly experience.

3.Domain Driven Design: This part focuses on understanding the domain and developing a design that aligns with the specific requirements of bicycle inspection.

4.AI and Chatbot: This section explores the integration of artificial intelligence and chatbot technologies into the system.

5.Responsive Web Development: Here, the focus is on creating a responsive web interface for the system.

6.Building Relational Database: The final part involves designing and implementing a relational database to store and manage the necessary data.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into separate directories for each part of the project. Each directory contains the relevant code, documentation, and any additional resources pertaining to that particular phase of development.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, please refer to the individual directories corresponding to each part of the project. Each directory includes a README file with detailed instructions on setting up and running the code for that specific phase.
